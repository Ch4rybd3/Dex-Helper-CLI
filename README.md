# Dex-Helper-CLI
A pokedex/shiny hunting helper in python for CLI

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Python libraries "colorama" and "tabulate"

You can just go and use :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
Once you have clone the repository and downloaded the prerequisite (or pip install -r requirements.txt), you can just launch the script at the root of the folder like this 
```
python main.py
```

You will have to select the region youi  will be shiny hunting, then the area.
The table will show you every revelant data concerning the pokemons you will be able to encounter such as held items, lvl, type, rarity, ... as seen in the dex, like a reverse dex where you search by location instead of Pokemons.

But the true value is in the 4 last columns as they will indicate what risky moves, items or boring abilities the mon can have, based on his dex data.

The last column contains recommendations for every scenarios so you can get prepared and not risk a lost shiny that you didn't expected or didn't prepared well enough for.
